# machine-learning
Learning about ML by covering foundational topics in jupyter notebooks, using a mix of tensorflow2 models (Based on the the freecodecamp.org course on machine learning) and my own implementations. Furthermore there are a couple of theory notebooks where I work through the math or concepts for different models.
The jupyter notebooks don't render properly in the github preview, you have to clone the repo.
